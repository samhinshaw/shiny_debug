# Tutorial Topics

## Part 1 - Simple Debugging

We're getting weird and inconsistent errors, how can we figure out what is going on?

* Examine error message
* Check stack trace
* Can't check code because it relies on Shiny `input`!
* Should we use a `print()` statement?
* Initiate debugger
  * `browser()`
  * breakpoint
* Step through functions
* Inspect variables during runtime
* Execute code from source document

## Part 2 - Advanced Debugging

* Code splitting
* Can't place breakpoint in split code
* Step into function
